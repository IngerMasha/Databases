SELECT COUNT(*) 
FROM FirstTab AS ft 
WHERE ft.id NOT IN ( SELECT id FROM SecondTab WHERE id IS NULL );
--- I thought there would be 3 results, actually 0

SELECT COUNT(*) 
FROM FirstTab AS ft WHERE ft.id NOT IN ( SELECT id FROM SecondTab WHERE id = 5 );
---3 rows exept id=5?, actually 2

SELECT COUNT(*) 
FROM FirstTab AS ft WHERE ft.id NOT IN ( SELECT id FROM SecondTab );
---2 - 6   Sharlee and 7   Krish, actually 0.
---here i undestand that comparison with NULL returns undefined result

SELECT COUNT(*) 
FROM FirstTab AS ft WHERE ft.id NOT IN ( SELECT id FROM SecondTab WHERE id IS NOT NULL );
------2 - 6   Sharlee and 7   Krish. 
---because in SecondTab not null is 5 and not 5 is 6,7, and the NULL from FirstTab, but we can't compare with NULL, so it is just 6 and 7.
